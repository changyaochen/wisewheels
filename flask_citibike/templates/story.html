              In this page, I like to record how this project has evolved. This is for my <a href="http://insightdatascience.com/" target="_blank">Insight Data Science</a> project. The Insight project is designed to be finished in 4 weeks, from the project idea, to the final deliverable such as this website. I would say the schedule is very tight: to have a good project idea is already not an easy task, not to mention the many technical holes that one often need to fill during the process (such as general machine learning techniques, web-scraping, or front-end development as in my case). There are many late nights, and more importantly, I have the rush in the morning to wake up and get to work, just like in graduate school! I do very much enjoy the process. <br><br>

              <b> <a id="why">Why I am interested.</a> </b>
              <br><br>
              I came to Insight with some vague project ideas in mind, and some exploration with the <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data" targe="_blank">Citibike data</a> is one of them. After the project idea "brain-strom" in the first week, with many idea came and went (where I learn to embrace the term "fail fast and fail early"), I finally settle down with this Citibike project. I am not a stranger to Citibike: when it was launched in 2013, I was among the first to sign up for the membership, and used it quite often, but it didn't have any station installed close to where I lived (Columbia University), the north-most station only touches the south side of the Central Park. When I return to the city this year, I found that there are stations as far-north as 110th street. Considering that a monthly Subway ticket will cost me about the same price as the annual Citibike membership, and Insight's office is right at the center of Flatiron, therefore I immediately signed up and started using Citibike for commute. <br><br>

              One problem though, is that it is very tricky to find a bike. In the morning, I need to get to the 110th station well before 8 am, before all the bikes run out. There are few times that I need to walk to next bike station (usually ~ 5 blocks away), with the hope to find some bikes are still available. By the time I got to Insight's office, the problem becomes to find an empty dock - the bike station right across Insight is almost always full, luckly there is a large bike station just one block away, hence it is less a concer. The same routine happens for the return trips. Although I don't expect that I can find a Citibike anytime from any station, but I really wish the bike availability can be more better addressed, and therefore I started this project. I am not being naive to believe this will bring the magic soltuion of any kind, there are people devoting a <a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/40922" target="_blank">PhD thesis</a> on this problem. Citibike do have put in effort to better address this rebalencing problem, with various bulk bike tranfer protocols. Lately, Citibike just launched <a href="http://bikeangels.citibikenyc.com/" target="_blank">bike angels program</a> to incentivize riders to take bikes from bike-rich stations to bike-poor station. Here, I like to see, with the available data, what can we learn, and hopefully lent some insight to Citibike. <br><br>

              <b> <a id="data">The 'raw' data.</a> </b>
              <br><br>
              The <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data", targe="_blank">data</a> available are the trip data, from the beginning (mid-2013) until early this year (2017): there are more than 35 million trips! One (really) nice thing about the Citibike data is that they are very <b>clean</b>: the data is organized monthly, in .csv format, with only few N/A values to deal with. For each trip, the recorded information are: start station (name, id, latitude and longitude), start date / time, end station (name, id, latitude and longitude), trip duration, and bike ID. If the rider is an annual member, then the gender and age are also recorded, otherwise (short-term user) these two fields are not available. Overall, more than 90% of the trips are taken by annual members, and I will only focus my effort data with these annual members. <br><br>

              One nice thing about working with Citibike data is that, there are many demographic data about New York can be easily found, for example, from </a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/" target="_blank">NYC Open Data</a>, or <a href="https://www.census.gov/" targe="_blank">US Census</a> and <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/" target="_blank">American Community Survey</a>. During the course of this project, I've also queried <a href="https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview" target="_blank">Yelp API</a> for various local information. In the following sections, I will describe how I use (or not) use them.<br><br>
              
              <b> <a id="goal">The goal, and the benchmarks.</a> </b>
              <br><br>
              Simply put, the goal of this project is <b>to predict the end neighborhood of a Citibike ride when the bike is picked up by a member</b>. If one can accurately predict the destinations of ongoing trips, then it can better guide the short-term rebalencing plans: the free bikes will be sent to the would-be bike-poor neighborhoods, in order to replenish the bike availability as soon as possible. I am not trying to predict exactly which <b>station</b> the trip will go to: it just sound impossible intuitively: when I am riding a Citibike, I won't be sure which station I will be end up with (to have available docks). Even at neighborhood level, I don't know how well I can do. But let's define a metric to measure the success: the simpliest one just the precentage of right answer (end neighborhood) the model predicts: 0 is the worst and 100% is the best. <br><br>
